The Problem Sets above were required to pass the course. I am not allowed to put my code online for public viewing.

Youtube Video Demonstrations for these problem sets would reveal all the code, this is why I have no link avaliable for demonstrations.

I have completed this course and recieved a verified certificate through EDX.
